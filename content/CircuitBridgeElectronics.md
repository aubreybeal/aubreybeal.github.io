HOW do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice. Irwin and Nelms propose that learning circuit analysis is similar to learning a musical instrument. [^fn1] During my undergraduate studies, a professor told me candidly that without hundreds of attempts at solving circuit problems many students may never obtain a passing grade. Practice. The same way that 'noodling' on a guitar doesn't often equip someone to play Purple Rain's solo, unstructured or under-practiced circuit study may seldom result in fluency of the tools used to build sophisticated electronic systems. Practice towards circuit analysis follows a method that reinforces specific skills. These skills can be combined and enable...
