**Course Title:** EE 315 Introduction to Electronic Analysis & Design   
**ABET Course Description:** This course focuses on properties of diodes, bipolar transistors, FET and operational amplifiers, analysis of DC and AC small-signal operation and circuit models for the design and analysis of electronic circuits.  
**Objectives:** Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to: 

>1. Analyze circuits containing op amps, resistors, and capacitors
>2. Use op amps to design amplifiers having precise characteristics
>3. Understand the operation of the PN junction, diodes, MOSFET transistors, and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)
>4. Understand how the voltage between two terminals of the transistor controls the current that flows through the third terminal and the equations that describe these current-voltage characteristics.
>5. Analyze and design circuits that contain transistors (MOSFET and BJT), resistors, and dc sources
>6. Make an amplifier using a transistor

*A note on prereq material:* Electronics courses build heavily on previously mastered skills acquired through significant practice in regards to pre-engineering STEM courses and electronic circuit analysis. There can be growing pains as developing engineers transition from demonstrating prereq knowledge in their respective prereq courses and actually applying the prereq knowledge to design and analyze real-world electronic circuits. Some additional thoughts (tutorial support) that may help with 'connecting the dots' between undergraduate circuits-related courses and first-time, university-level electronics courses can be found [here](/posts/bridgingthegap).
**<center>Suggested 'second-nature' skills from prerequisite courses:</center>**

>1. Basic engineering mathematics:
>>solving systems of equations, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, complex numbers, rational functions, complex exponential-sinusoidal function relationship
>2. Using Ohm's law to find a desired current, voltage or impedance.
>1. I-V Curves for voltage sources, current sources and resistors.
>1. Identifying circuit loops to apply KVL to obtain an expression of an unknown voltage.
>1. Identifying circuit nodes to apply KCL to obtain an expression of an unknown current.
>1. Mesh and nodal analysis
>1. Using voltage/current dividers that result in expressions of desired, unknown quantities.
>1. Recongizing elements and parallel and collapsing them into a simplier equivalent circuit.
>1. ThÃ©venin & Norton equivalent circuits.
>1. Time-domain/transient RC circuits.
>1. Laplace transforms (notions for frequency-domain RC circuits).
