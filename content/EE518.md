**Course Title:** EE 418/518 Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos  
**ABET Course Description:** This course provides students with an introduction nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Topics will address system stability, linearization, equilibrium/steady-state solutions, bifurcations, periodic solutions, limit cycles, oscillators, chaos, iterated maps and chaos control/synchronization. Various tools and methods used for analysis and design of nonlinear circuits and systems will be covered. When possible, systems will be treated analytically, however, general treatment of systems using numerical methods will be shown with MATLAB and/or Python. Ultimately, this course will provide experience for students beyond the limited behavior of low-degree linear circuits and systems towards complex behaviors where determinism doesn’t always imply predictability.  
**Objectives:** Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to: 
>1. Master the fundamentals of nonlinear dynamics: linearization, stability, bifurcation, chaos, iterated maps
>1. Identification of sources of nonlinearity in electronic systems
>1. Analyze and interpret data from nonlinear & chaotic systems
>1. Realistic design and analysis needed for practical oscillator design
>1. Analysis and design of chaotic systems
>1. Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering in dynamics related research areas
>1. A knowledge of contemporary issues regarding nonlinear dynamics & chaos.
