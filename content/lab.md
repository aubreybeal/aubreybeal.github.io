### The Nonlinear & Complex Systems (NACS) Lab Facility

Our group works with UAHâ€˜s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering which is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities such as the electromagnetic anechoic chamber, cybersecurity, RF and mixed-signal electronics and signal processing laboratories. Faculty experts guide research in cybersecurity, health monitoring, antennas, and radar systems for industrial, commercial and defense applications. Nonlinear Signal Processing Laboratory The Nonlinear Signal Processing Lab has electronic design, simulation and fabrication workstations equipped with measurement devices suitable for both time and frequency domain measurements up to the 3GHz range. Specifically relevant equipment includes software CAD tools (including MATLAB, Cadence, LTspice, etc.), power supplies, oscilloscopes, spectrometers, network analyzers, function generators, circuit board assembly equipment, etc. UAH also is home to a world-class near-field anechoic chamber that may be used for RF testing and measurement. Departmental Radar Facilites The radar and signal processing laboratory at UAH contains 12 Time Domain P410 Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio units. These units can be used for precise ranging, ad hoc network formation, radar sensing and signal processing. These units are used in our signal processing laboratory to provide students with real data for signal processing experiments and to give students an introduction to radar fundamentals. These units and our three Sivers K-band FMCW radar units are used by students for senior design projects and graduate research.
