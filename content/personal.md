### Courses

**EE 315 Introduction to Electronic Analysis & Design:** This course highlights the properties of diode, bipolar transistors, FET and operational amplifiers, analysis of DC and AC small-signal operation and circuit models for the design and analysis of electronic circuits. Prerequisite: EE 213 (Electric Circuit Analysis I)

**EE 316 Electric Circuits & Electronic Design Lab:** This hands-on laboratory allows students to construct several design circuits and master the use of electronic measurement instrumentation. These labs emphasize electrical engineering concepts through a practical approach, that allows students to gain significant experience with electrical instruments such as function generators, digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, step down transformers, power supplies, operational amplifiers, etc. Topics covered include KCL, KVL, Norton/Thevenin equivalent circuits, inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, differentiators and integrators, bridge rectifiers, AC/DC converters, filter design, and signal amplification using BJTs, JFETs and MOSFETs. Finally, students measure various electronic device characteristics. Pre/Corequisite: EE315 (Introduction to Electronic Analysis & Design)

**EE 382 Analytic Methods of Continuous Time Signals & Systems:** This course...Fourier Series, Fourier and Laplace transforms with emphasis on their physical interpretation. System representation by transfer functions and impulse response functions, convolution integral, transient response, and modeling and simulation. Prerequisites: EE 213 (Electric Circuit Analysis I), MA 238 (APPLIED DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS), and MA 244 (INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR ALGEBRA).

**EE 383 Analytic Methods of Discrete Time & Multivariable Signals & Systems:** This course focuses on discrete-time signals and systems, sampling techniques, Z and discrete Fourier transforms, multivariable systems. Introduction to digital signal processing. Though some techniques from the continuous-time domain map to this course, important and practical differences between continuous-time and discrete-time systesm are highlighted. As a result, students are prepared for real-world realities involved in modern signal processing that leads to data acquisition, filtering and controls. In this course students performe discrete-time and frequency domain analysis, analyze the A/D process, develop the discrete Fourier transform, develop the Z-transform and implement basic FIR and IIR filters. Prerequisite: EE 382 (Analytic Methods of Continuous Time Signals & Systems).


**EE 410/510 Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos:** This course provides students with an introduction nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Topics will address system stability, linearization, equilibrium/steady-state solutions, bifurcations, periodic solutions, limit cycles, oscillators, chaos, iterated maps and chaos control/synchronization. Various tools and methods used for analysis and design of nonlinear circuits and systems will be covered. When possible, systems will be treated analytically, however, general treatment of systems using numerical methods will be shown with MATLAB and/or Python. Ultimately, this course will provide experience for students beyond the limited behavior of low-degree linear circuits and systems towards complex behaviors where determinism doesnâ€™t always imply predictability.

**EE 410/510 Fundamentals of Radar Systems:** This course provides students with an introduction to radar systems and basic radar analysis. Common radar topologies and construction methods are provided. Particular focus on analysis of the radar range equation and its various terms is given. The radar range equation allows characterization of the energy found in transmitted/received signals and a corresponding noisy environment. This fundamental equation is key for all aspects of radar design and analysis including peak and average power, directive gain of antennas, target characteristics, operating frequencies, waveform properties, noise and loss factors. The information in this course describes transmission, reception and processing in radar systems even when the signals of interest are embedded in noise.

**EE 410/510 Open-source Integrated Circuit Design:** This course provides
