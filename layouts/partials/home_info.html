<b>Fields of interest:</b> Electronics, nonlinear dynamics & chaos </br>
<b>Research statement:</b> I build electronic circuits to study how systems facilitate the emergence of structure, complexity, computation and entropy in their dynamics. I am interested in the engineered production of entropy where many resulting details offer rich mystery and deep connections to communication, security and artificial intellegence.</br>


<!--My work focuses at the intersection of electrical engineering and nonlinear dynamics (espeically chaotic phenomena). I study how electronic systems can facilitate the emergence of structure, complexity, computational substrates and entropy. I am particularly interested in the role that information theory can offer new perspectives for complex systems and the entropic waveforms they produce. My lab builds experimental hardware to guide and inform the next generation of electronics and signal processing techniques. I hope to use these unique viewpoints to impact design sensors, secure data and process information. For example, some of our groupâ€™s recent projects have focused on novel, experimental acoustic/RF noise ranging sensors, true random number generators (TRNGs), physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and unconvential machine learning systems (known as reservoir computers).

I am interested in nonlinear dynamic phenomena and in understanding the emergence of structure, complexity, and computational ability in systems of interacting adaptive components. In my lab we use table top experiments together with numeric modeling and analytic work to explore fundamental questions in nonlinear dynamics. The knowledge gained through the study of well controlled electronic and photonic systems then informs our understanding of many physical, biological, social, and technological systems.

A focus of my research are systems in which oscillatory dynamics arises because of time-delayed feedback. In lab, we utilize both electronic and optoelectronic devices. Understanding the dynamics of the individual devices contributes to our knowledge of chaos and nonlinear dynamics in time-delay systems. Coupling several devices allows the investigation of emergent network behavior.-->

<b>Teaching statement:</b> I love to learn, especially when I can share with others in a collaborative and playful learning environment. My courses often boot-strap from practical observations and build toward challenges that engage students to think beyond traditional boundaries.</br>

Teaching overview:
I love electonics, nonlinear dynamics and most of all working/learning with students. As an educator, my goal is to empower students to think critically and creatively using results in electroincs, signal processing and nonlinear dynamics. I believe that we can explore sophisticated ideas and challenge ourselves to think beyond traditional boundaries by fostering a collaborative and playful learning environment. Considering this philosophy, my classroom values setbacks as well as successes. In my courses, students can expect to engage with material in a creative way that is routed in theory and then applied to real-world scenarios. I often share my practical design experience, especially in response to questions. When a student, colleague or myself becomes stymied (either mathematically or through hardware design), my classroom/lab provides a place to learn, experiment and grow through many methods including theoretical development, simulation and even experimental validation of hardware. By connecting dynamical systems theory with electrical engineering practice in this way, my students and I often deepen our understanding of new and surprising behaviors that can arise in electronics, particularly in graduate-level courses.

Whether you are just starting your journey or seeking to deepen your knowledge in electronics, signal processing, or nonlinear dynamics (chaos, complex systems, etc.), I am excited to work with passionate students. My door is always open, and I am eager to support you as you pursue your academic and professional goals.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you!

About me:
Professional Biography: Dr. Beal earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Auburn University in 2015. His research uses concepts in nonlinear dynamics to innovate techniques for communication systems, compressive noise ranging systems, and true random number generation in integrated circuits. As a postdoctoral researcher with the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, he applied these concepts to offer unique advantages to physical systems. He has worked industrially in bulk power transmission planning with Southern Company, mixed-signal electronics for power supply design in high performance computers at IBM, low-noise electroincs/embedded systesms for metal detector designs. Before joining UAH, Dr. Beal was a civil servant researcher with the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (now Futures Command CCDC) Charles M. Bowden Laboratory at Redstone Arsenal. His work supported early basic and applied research involving nonlinear dynamical systesms and electronics design. Currently, his research interests highlight the intersection of nonlinear dynamics and engineering applications to support advances in electronics, signal processing, and machine learning. Dr. Beal is a senior member of the IEEE, faculty advisor for the HKN honor society, and has authored numerous jounal papers, conference papers and patents.

Here are some questions to help get started: How are you solving or making essential steps to solving a critical problem? Are you or do you aim to introduce any new techniques or methodologies with significant impact? The next questions will go on to form you abstract

What has been done by others/what do you plan to do?

What are the important details?

Why is it novel or what is the issue at hand?

What is presented/included in this work?

What is the big picture of the contribution? Where does it fit in with the community?

For example: NOTE YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN MY EXAMPLE. IT WAS WRITTEN WITH HARDLY ANY THOUGHTâ€¦ Title: Real-time Machine Learning via Open-source Hardware Description: We present a real-time machine learning approach that uses inexpensive, open-source hardware. Notably, many machine learning techniques must use extensive computational resources, demand significant cost and processing must be performed later. We will provide hardware verification of a real-time machine learning system that process audio input using only inexpensive, open-source hardware as opposed to a dedicated network of high-performance computers. This approach uses recent advancements in hobbyist computing paired with significant new capabilities provided via machine learning techniques. We will show basic functionality such as classification and/or signal processing of input audio signals using neural topologies such as convolutional neural networks and auto-encoders. The result will be audio demonstration of advanced machine learning algorithms using accessible hardware and software suitable for a broad community of users.
